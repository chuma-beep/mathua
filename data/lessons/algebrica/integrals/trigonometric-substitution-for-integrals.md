## How trigonometric substitution works

Trigonometric substitution is a method for evaluating [integrals](<../indefinite-integrals/>) that contain [square roots](<../radicals/>) of quadratic expressions. Certain algebraic forms become considerably easier to handle once they are rewritten using the [Pythagorean identities](<../pythagorean-identity/>) of trigonometry. The method consists of a change of variables \\(x=\phi(\theta)\\) chosen so that the quadratic expression under the radical is transformed into the square of a trigonometric function in the new variable.

After an appropriate algebraic manipulation, many integrals in elementary calculus can be reduced to one of the following canonical forms, with \\(a > 0\\):

\\[\sqrt{a^2-x^2} \\] \\[\sqrt{x^2+a^2} \\] \\[\sqrt{x^2-a^2} \\]

For the radical to be real-valued, the variable \\( x \\) must lie in the corresponding domain:

  * \\(\sqrt{a^2 - x^2}\; \\) requires \\(x \in [-a, a]\\)
  * \\(\sqrt{x^2 + a^2}\, \\) is defined \\(\forall \, x \in \mathbb{R}\\)
  * \\(\sqrt{x^2 - a^2}\, \\) requires \\(x \in (-\infty, -a] \cup [a, \infty)\\)


These restrictions are essential, since they determine not only where the integrand is defined, but also the admissible range of the auxiliary angle \\( \theta \\) introduced in the substitution. In particular, the choice of the [interval](<../intervals/>) for \\( \theta \\) ensures that inverse trigonometric functions are well defined and that absolute values arising from square roots can be handled consistently. Each of these expressions is naturally linked to a [Pythagorean identity](<../pythagorean-identity/>):

\\[1-\sin^2\theta=\cos^2\theta \\] \\[1+\tan^2\theta=\sec^2\theta \\] \\[\sec^2\theta-1=\tan^2\theta\\]

> The substitution in each case is chosen so that the term inside the square root matches the left-hand side of one of these identities, which turns the radical into an expression without radicals. Integrals involving rational functions of \\( \sin x \\) and \\( \cos x \\) are instead usually treated through the [Weierstrass substitution](<../the-weierstrass-substitution/>), which transforms trigonometric expressions into rational functions of a new variable.


In practice, the expression under the square root is rarely presented in one of the three canonical forms straight away. A common preliminary step is to rewrite a general quadratic \\(ax^2+bx+c\\) in a form that matches one of the standard patterns, by [completing the square](<../completing-the-square/>). For instance, \\(x^2+4x+5\\) becomes \\((x+2)^2+1\\) after completing the square, which is of the form \\(u^2+a^2\\) with \\(u=x+2\\) and \\(a=1\\). Once the quadratic has been rewritten in this way, a simple substitution \\(u=x+k\\) reduces the integral to one of the three cases described below, and the appropriate trigonometric substitution can then be applied.

> Recognizing this preliminary step often determines which substitution is needed. When the integrand does not immediately match a familiar pattern, the rewriting by completing the square is what makes the correct case visible.

  * definition 1.  A method for evaluating integrals containing square roots of quadratic expressions. It consists of a change of variables \\( x = \phi(\theta) \\) chosen so that the quadratic expression under the radical is transformed into the square of a trigonometric function in the new variable, allowing the radical to be removed through a Pythagorean identity.


## From substitutions to geometry

From a geometric point of view, these substitutions can be interpreted as parametrizations of conic sections. The bullet list below introduces the correspondence between each Pythagorean identity and the curve it describes:

  * The identity \\(\sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta = 1\\) corresponds to the [unit circle](<../unit-circle/>) and underlies the case \\(\sqrt{a^2 - x^2}\\).
  * The identities \\(1 + \tan^2\theta = \sec^2\theta\\) and \\(\sec^2\theta - 1 = \tan^2\theta\\) are related to the geometry of the [hyperbola](<../hyperbola/>) \\(x^2 - y^2 = a^2\\), and underlie the forms \\(\sqrt{x^2 + a^2}\\) and \\(\sqrt{x^2 - a^2}\\).


Trigonometric substitution can therefore be understood as a geometric reparametrization of quadratic curves, and not only as an algebraic device.

## The form \\(\sqrt{a^2-x^2}\\)

When the integrand contains an expression of the form \\( \sqrt{a^2 - x^2} \\), it is appropriate to introduce a trigonometric substitution that reflects the [Pythagorean identity](<../pythagorean-identity/>) \\( 1 - \sin^2\theta = \cos^2\theta \\), which itself follows from the fundamental relation between [sine and cosine](<../sine-and-cosine/>). For this reason, we set:

\\[x = a \sin\theta \\]

so that the algebraic quantity under the square root can be rewritten in terms of a trigonometric [function](<../functions/>). Differentiating both sides of the substitution with respect to \\( \theta \\), we obtain:

\\[dx = a \cos\theta \, d\theta \\]

Substituting \\( x = a \sin\theta \\) into the radical expression, we can rewrite the square root as follows:

\\[\sqrt{a^2 - x^2} = \sqrt{a^2 - a^2 \sin^2\theta} \\]

Factoring out \\( a^2 \\) from the expression inside the radical yields:

\\[\sqrt{a^2(1 - \sin^2\theta)} \\]

Using the identity \\( 1 - \sin^2\theta = \cos^2\theta \\), this becomes:

\\[\sqrt{a^2 \cos^2\theta} = a \sqrt{\cos^2\theta} = a |\cos\theta| \\]

To avoid ambiguity related to the absolute value, it is customary to restrict the angle \\( \theta \\) to the interval:

\\[\theta \in \left[-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}\right] \\]

since on this interval we have \\( \cos\theta \ge 0 \\). Under this restriction, the absolute value is no longer necessary, and the radical simplifies to:

\\[\sqrt{a^2 - x^2} = a \cos\theta \\]

Finally, returning to the original variable \\( x \\), the relationships implied by the substitution can be written explicitly as:

\\[\sin\theta = \frac{x}{a} \\]

\\[\cos\theta = \frac{\sqrt{a^2 - x^2}}{a} \\]

and therefore the angle can be expressed through the [arcsine](<../arcsine-and-arccosine/>):

\\[\theta = \arcsin\left(\frac{x}{a}\right) \\]

These relations allow us to express the final result of the integration entirely in terms of the original variable.

> A geometric interpretation is often helpful. If \\(\sin\theta=x/a\\), one may use a [right triangle](<../right-triangle-trigonometry/>) with hypotenuse \\(a\\), opposite side \\(x\\), and adjacent side \\(\sqrt{a^2-x^2}\\).


The standard correspondences for \\(\sqrt{a^2-x^2}\\) can be summarized as follows:

  * Radical form: \\(\sqrt{a^2-x^2}\\)
  * Substitution: \\(x=a\sin\theta\\)
  * Identity used: \\(1-\sin^2\theta=\cos^2\theta\\)


  * definition 2.  The canonical radical form treated by the substitution \\( x = a\sin\theta \\), with \\( \theta \in \left[-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}\right] \\). It relies on the Pythagorean identity \\( 1 - \sin^2\theta = \cos^2\theta \\), which reduces the radical to \\( a\cos\theta \\) on the chosen interval. The back-substitution uses \\( \sin\theta = \frac{x}{a} \\) and \\( \cos\theta = \frac{\sqrt{a^2 - x^2}}{a} \\), with \\( \theta = \arcsin\left(\frac{x}{a}\right) \\).


## Geometric interpretation

When working with trigonometric substitutions, it is often useful to visualize the relationship between \\(\theta\\) and \\(x\\) through a right triangle. Reading the values of the trigonometric functions directly from the sides of the triangle removes the need to solve for \\(\theta\\) explicitly.

![trigonometric-substitution-for-integrals](/diagrams/algebrica/trigonometric-substitution-for-integrals-1.svg)

From \\(x = a\sin\theta\\), we construct a right triangle where:

  * the hypotenuse is \\(a\\)
  * the opposite side is \\(x\\)
  * the adjacent side is \\(\sqrt{a^2 - x^2}\\)


Since \\(\sin\theta = \frac{x}{a}\\), it follows that \\(\cos\theta = \frac{\sqrt{a^2 - x^2}}{a}\\). This geometric representation allows all trigonometric functions of \\(\theta\\) to be rewritten directly in terms of \\(x\\).

> The same construction applies to the other two standard forms. For \\(\sqrt{x^2+a^2}\\) one draws a triangle with opposite side \\(x\\), adjacent side \\(a\\), and hypotenuse \\(\sqrt{x^2+a^2}\\); for \\(\sqrt{x^2-a^2}\\) the hypotenuse becomes \\(x\\), the adjacent side \\(a\\), and the opposite side \\(\sqrt{x^2-a^2}\\). In each case the triangle is built directly from the substitution and serves as a guide for the back-substitution step.

## Example 1

Let us evaluate the following integral:

\\[\int \sqrt{a^2 - x^2}\,dx \quad (a>0) \\]

Since the integrand contains the expression \\( \sqrt{a^2 - x^2} \\), we introduce the trigonometric substitution:

\\[x = a\sin\theta \quad \theta \in \left[-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}\right]\\]

so that we can use the identity \\( 1 - \sin^2\theta = \cos^2\theta \\) with \\( \cos\theta \ge 0 \\) on this interval. Differentiating the substitution gives:

\\[dx = a\cos\theta\,d\theta \\]

We now rewrite the radical:

\\[\sqrt{a^2 - x^2} = \sqrt{a^2 - a^2\sin^2\theta} = a\sqrt{1 - \sin^2\theta} = a\cos\theta \\]

Substituting everything into the integral we obtain:

\\[\begin{align} \int \sqrt{a^2 - x^2}\,dx &= \int (a\cos\theta)(a\cos\theta\,d\theta) \\\\[6pt] &= a^2\int \cos^2\theta\,d\theta \end{align} \\]

To integrate \\( \cos^2\theta \\), we use the [double-angle identity](<../reduction-formulas-and-reference-angles/>):

\\[\cos^2\theta = \frac{1+\cos 2\theta}{2} \\]

Therefore:

\\[a^2\int \cos^2\theta\,d\theta = \frac{a^2}{2}\int (1+\cos 2\theta)\,d\theta \\]

Integrating term by term we have:

\\[\frac{a^2}{2}\theta + \frac{a^2}{4}\sin 2\theta + c \\]

Returning to the variable \\(x\\), from the substitution \\( x = a\sin\theta \\), we have:

\\[\theta = \arcsin\left(\frac{x}{a}\right) \\]

To rewrite \\( \sin 2\theta \\), we use:

\\[\sin 2\theta = 2\sin\theta\cos\theta \\]

Since the substitution gives:

\\[\sin\theta=\frac{x}{a} \qquad \cos\theta=\frac{\sqrt{a^2-x^2}}{a} \\]

we obtain:

\\[\sin 2\theta = 2\cdot \frac{x}{a}\cdot \frac{\sqrt{a^2-x^2}}{a} = \frac{2x\sqrt{a^2-x^2}}{a^2} \\]

Substituting back:

\\[\frac{a^2}{2}\theta + \frac{a^2}{4}\sin 2\theta = \frac{a^2}{2}\arcsin\left(\frac{x}{a}\right) + \frac{x}{2}\sqrt{a^2-x^2} \\]

The result is:

\\[\int \sqrt{a^2 - x^2}\,dx = \frac{x}{2}\sqrt{a^2-x^2} + \frac{a^2}{2}\arcsin\left(\frac{x}{a}\right) + c \\]

> This completes the computation. The integral has been reduced to a trigonometric form, evaluated using standard identities, and finally rewritten entirely in terms of the original variable \\(x\\).

## The form \\(\sqrt{x^2+a^2}\\)

When the integrand contains an expression of the form \\( \sqrt{x^2 + a^2} \\), it is convenient to introduce a substitution based on the [Pythagorean identity](<../pythagorean-identity/>):

\\[1 + \tan^2\theta = \sec^2\theta \\]

which relates the [tangent](<../tangent-and-cotangent/>) and the [secant](<../secant-and-cosecant/>). For this reason, we set \\(x = a \tan\theta\\) so that the quadratic expression inside the square root can be rewritten in terms of a trigonometric function. Differentiating both sides with respect to \\( \theta \\), we obtain:

\\[dx = a \sec^2\theta \, d\theta \\]

Substituting \\( x = a \tan\theta \\) into the radical expression gives:

\\[\sqrt{x^2 + a^2} = \sqrt{a^2 \tan^2\theta + a^2} \\]

Factoring out \\( a^2 \\) from the expression inside the square root, we obtain:

\\[\sqrt{a^2(\tan^2\theta + 1)} \\]

Using the identity \\( 1 + \tan^2\theta = \sec^2\theta \\), this becomes:

\\[\sqrt{a^2 \sec^2\theta} = a \sqrt{\sec^2\theta} = a |\sec\theta| \\]

To eliminate the ambiguity introduced by the absolute value, it is standard to restrict the angle \\( \theta \\) to the following interval:

\\[\theta \in \left(-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}\right) \\]

since on this interval \\( \cos\theta > 0 \\) and therefore \\( \sec\theta > 0 \\). Under this restriction, the radical simplifies to:

\\[\sqrt{x^2 + a^2} = a \sec\theta \\]

Returning to the original variable \\( x \\), the relationships implied by the substitution can be written explicitly as:

\\[\tan\theta = \frac{x}{a}\\] \\[\sec\theta = \frac{\sqrt{x^2 + a^2}}{a}\\] \\[\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{x}{a}\right)\\]

> The corresponding geometric interpretation is immediate. From the relation \\( \tan\theta = \frac{x}{a} \\), one may construct a right triangle in which the adjacent side has length \\( a \\), the opposite side has length \\( x \\), and the hypotenuse, by the [Pythagorean theorem](<../pythagorean-theorem/>), has length \\( \sqrt{x^2 + a^2} \\). This triangle provides a geometric picture of the substitution and helps visualize why the radical expression becomes a trigonometric function.


The standard correspondences for \\(\sqrt{x^2+a^2}\\) can be summarized as follows:

  * Radical form: \\(\sqrt{x^2+a^2}\\)
  * Substitution: \\(x=a\tan\theta\\)
  * Identity used: \\(1+\tan^2\theta=\sec^2\theta\\)


  * definition 3.  The canonical radical form treated by the substitution \\( x = a\tan\theta \\), with \\( \theta \in \left(-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}\right) \\). It relies on the Pythagorean identity \\( 1 + \tan^2\theta = \sec^2\theta \\), which reduces the radical to \\( a\sec\theta \\) on the chosen interval. The back-substitution uses \\( \tan\theta = \frac{x}{a} \\) and \\( \sec\theta = \frac{\sqrt{x^2 + a^2}}{a} \\), with \\( \theta = \arctan\left(\frac{x}{a}\right) \\).


## Example 2

Let us evaluate the following integral:

\\[\int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{x^2+a^2}} \quad (a>0) \\]

Since the integrand contains the expression \\(\sqrt{x^2+a^2}\\), we introduce the trigonometric substitution:

\\[x = a\tan\theta \quad \theta \in \left(-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}\right)\\]

so that we can use the identity \\(1+\tan^2\theta=\sec^2\theta\\) with \\(\sec\theta > 0\\) on this interval. Differentiating the substitution gives:

\\[dx = a\sec^2\theta\,d\theta \\]

We now rewrite the radical:

\\[\begin{align} \sqrt{x^2+a^2} &= \sqrt{a^2\tan^2\theta+a^2} \\\\[6pt] &= a\sqrt{\tan^2\theta+1} \\\\[11pt] &= a\sec\theta \end{align} \\]

Substituting everything into the integral we obtain:

\\[\int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{x^2+a^2}} = \int \frac{a\sec^2\theta}{a\sec\theta}\,d\theta = \int \sec\theta\,d\theta \\]

To evaluate \\(\int\sec\theta\,d\theta\\), we multiply numerator and denominator by \\(\sec\theta+\tan\theta\\):

\\[\begin{align} \int \sec\theta\,d\theta &= \int \frac{\sec\theta(\sec\theta+\tan\theta)}{\sec\theta+\tan\theta}\,d\theta \\\\[6pt] &= \int \frac{\sec^2\theta+\sec\theta\tan\theta}{\sec\theta+\tan\theta}\,d\theta \end{align} \\]

Setting \\( u = \sec\theta+\tan\theta \\), we have \\( du = (\sec^2\theta+\sec\theta\tan\theta)\,d\theta \\), so the numerator is exactly \\( du \\) and the integral reduces to:

\\[\int \frac{du}{u} = \ln|u|+c = \ln|\sec\theta+\tan\theta|+c \\]

Returning to the variable \\(x\\), since:

\\[\tan\theta = \frac{x}{a} \qquad \sec\theta = \frac{\sqrt{x^2+a^2}}{a} \\]

we obtain:

\\[\ln|\sec\theta+\tan\theta|+c = \ln\left|\frac{\sqrt{x^2+a^2}+x}{a}\right|+c \\]

Since \\(\sqrt{x^2+a^2} > |x|\\) for all \\(x \in \mathbb{R}\\), the quantity \\(\sqrt{x^2+a^2}+x\\) is strictly positive, and the absolute value can be dropped. Moreover:

\\[\ln\left|\frac{\sqrt{x^2+a^2}+x}{a}\right| = \ln \\! \left(\sqrt{x^2+a^2}+x\right)-\ln a \\]

and \\(\ln a\\) is a constant that can be absorbed into \\(c\\).

The result is:

\\[\int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{x^2+a^2}} = \ln \\! \left(\sqrt{x^2+a^2}+x\right)+c \\]

> This completes the computation. The integral has been reduced to a trigonometric form, evaluated by a standard manipulation of the secant, and finally rewritten entirely in terms of the original variable \\(x\\).

## The form \\( \sqrt{x^2 - a^2} \\)

When the integrand contains an expression of the form \\( \sqrt{x^2 - a^2} \\), it is natural to introduce a substitution based on the [Pythagorean identity](<../pythagorean-identity/>):

\\[\sec^2\theta - 1 = \tan^2\theta \\]

which is equivalent to the fundamental relation \\( 1 + \tan^2\theta = \sec^2\theta \\). For this reason, we set:

\\[x = a \sec\theta \\]

so that the quadratic expression inside the square root can be rewritten in terms of trigonometric functions. Differentiating both sides with respect to \\( \theta \\), we obtain:

\\[dx = a \sec\theta \tan\theta \, d\theta \\]

Substituting \\( x = a \sec\theta \\) into the radical expression gives:

\\[\sqrt{x^2 - a^2} = \sqrt{a^2 \sec^2\theta - a^2} \\]

Factoring out \\( a^2 \\) inside the square root, we obtain:

\\[\sqrt{a^2(\sec^2\theta - 1)} \\]

Using the identity \\( \sec^2\theta - 1 = \tan^2\theta \\), this becomes:

\\[\sqrt{a^2 \tan^2\theta} = a \sqrt{\tan^2\theta} = a |\tan\theta| \\]

The presence of the absolute value reflects the fact that the sign of \\( \tan\theta \\) depends on the chosen domain for \\( \theta \\). For example, if we are working under the assumption \\( x \ge a \\), a convenient restriction is:

\\[\theta \in \left[0, \frac{\pi}{2}\right) \\]

since on this interval we have \\( \sec\theta \ge 1 \\) and \\( \tan\theta \ge 0 \\). Under this restriction, the radical simplifies to:

\\[\sqrt{x^2 - a^2} = a \tan\theta \\]

> When \\(x \leq -a\\), one instead restricts \\(\theta \in \left(\frac{\pi}{2}, \pi\right]\\), so that \\(\sec\theta \leq -1\\) and \\(\tan\theta \leq 0\\); in that case \\(|\tan\theta| = -\tan\theta\\). For most textbook problems it suffices to assume \\(x \geq a\\) and work with the interval \\(\left[0,\frac{\pi}{2}\right)\\).


Returning to the original variable \\( x \\), the relationships implied by the substitution can be written explicitly as:

\\[\sec\theta = \frac{x}{a}\\] \\[\tan\theta = \frac{\sqrt{x^2 - a^2}}{a}\\]

Equivalently, one may express the angle itself through an inverse trigonometric function, writing:

\\[\theta = \operatorname{arcsec}\left(\frac{x}{a}\right) \\]

on a suitable domain. In many practical situations, however, it is sufficient to rewrite \\( \tan\theta \\) and \\( \sec\theta \\) directly in terms of \\( x \\) and \\( \sqrt{x^2 - a^2} \\), without explicitly solving for \\( \theta \\).

> The corresponding geometric interpretation follows directly from the relation \\(\sec\theta = x/a\\). One may construct a [right triangle](<../right-triangle-trigonometry/>) in which the hypotenuse has length \\(x\\), the adjacent side has length \\(a\\), and the opposite side, by the [Pythagorean theorem](<../pythagorean-theorem/>), has length \\(\sqrt{x^2-a^2}\\). This triangle makes the substitution geometrically transparent and provides a way to read off the values of \\(\sec\theta\\) and \\(\tan\theta\\) directly from the sides, without solving for \\(\theta\\) explicitly.

  * definition 4.  The canonical radical form treated by the substitution \\( x = a\sec\theta \\), with \\( \theta \in \left[0, \frac{\pi}{2}\right) \\) under the assumption \\( x \ge a \\). It relies on the Pythagorean identity \\( \sec^2\theta - 1 = \tan^2\theta \\), which reduces the radical to \\( a\tan\theta \\) on the chosen interval. The back-substitution uses \\( \sec\theta = \frac{x}{a} \\) and \\( \tan\theta = \frac{\sqrt{x^2 - a^2}}{a} \\).


## Example 3

Let us evaluate the following integral:

\\[\int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{x^2-a^2}} \quad (a>0, \; x>a) \\]

Since the integrand contains the expression \\(\sqrt{x^2-a^2}\\), we introduce the trigonometric substitution:

\\[x = a\sec\theta \quad \theta \in \left[0,\frac{\pi}{2}\right)\\]

so that we can use the identity \\(\sec^2\theta-1=\tan^2\theta\\) with \\(\tan\theta \ge 0\\) on this interval. Differentiating the substitution gives:

\\[dx = a\sec\theta\tan\theta\,d\theta \\]

We now rewrite the radical:

\\[\begin{align} \sqrt{x^2-a^2} &= \sqrt{a^2\sec^2\theta-a^2} \\\\[6pt] &= a\sqrt{\sec^2\theta-1} \\\\[6pt] &= a\tan\theta \end{align} \\]

Substituting everything into the integral we obtain:

\\[\int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{x^2-a^2}} = \int \frac{a\sec\theta\tan\theta}{a\tan\theta}\,d\theta = \int \sec\theta\,d\theta \\]

To evaluate \\(\int\sec\theta\,d\theta\\), we multiply numerator and denominator by \\(\sec\theta+\tan\theta\\):

\\[\begin{align} \int \sec\theta\,d\theta &= \int \frac{\sec\theta(\sec\theta+\tan\theta)}{\sec\theta+\tan\theta}\,d\theta \\\\[6pt] &= \int \frac{\sec^2\theta+\sec\theta\tan\theta}{\sec\theta+\tan\theta}\,d\theta \end{align} \\]

Setting \\( u = \sec\theta+\tan\theta \\), we have \\( du = (\sec^2\theta+\sec\theta\tan\theta)\,d\theta \\), so the numerator is exactly \\( du \\) and the integral reduces to:

\\[\int \frac{du}{u} = \ln|u|+c = \ln|\sec\theta+\tan\theta|+c \\]

Returning to the variable \\(x\\), since:

\\[\sec\theta = \frac{x}{a} \quad \tan\theta = \frac{\sqrt{x^2-a^2}}{a} \\]

we obtain:

\\[\ln|\sec\theta+\tan\theta|+c = \ln \\! \left|\frac{x+\sqrt{x^2-a^2}}{a}\right|+c \\]

Since \\(x > a > 0\\) and \\(\sqrt{x^2-a^2} \ge 0\\), the quantity \\(x+\sqrt{x^2-a^2}\\) is strictly positive, and the absolute value can be dropped. Moreover:

\\[\ln \\! \left(\frac{x+\sqrt{x^2-a^2}}{a}\right) = \ln \\! \left(x+\sqrt{x^2-a^2}\right)-\ln a \\]

and \\(\ln a\\) is a constant that can be absorbed into \\(c\\).

The result is:

\\[\int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{x^2-a^2}} = \ln \\! \left(x+\sqrt{x^2-a^2}\right)+c \\]

> This completes the computation. The structure of the derivation closely mirrors that of Example 2. In both cases the substitution reduces the integral to \\(\int\sec\theta\,d\theta\\), and the difference lies entirely in the back-substitution step, where the expressions for \\(\sec\theta\\) and \\(\tan\theta\\) in terms of \\(x\\) reflect the geometry of the two distinct radical forms.

## Example 4

The previous examples all began with a radical already written in one of the three canonical forms. In practice the quadratic under the square root is often a general trinomial, and the substitution becomes visible only after completing the square. Consider the following integral:

\\[\int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{x^2+4x+5}} \\]

The expression under the radical is not yet in a canonical form, so we first complete the square in the quadratic:

\\[x^2+4x+5 = (x+2)^2+1 \\]

This rewriting shows that the radical has the form \\(\sqrt{u^2+a^2}\\) with \\(u=x+2\\) and \\(a=1\\). We therefore introduce the auxiliary substitution:

\\[u = x+2 \qquad du = dx \\]

which transforms the integral into:

\\[\int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{x^2+4x+5}} = \int \frac{du}{\sqrt{u^2+1}} \\]

The integral on the right is exactly the canonical form treated in Example 2, with \\(a=1\\). Applying the trigonometric substitution \\(u=\tan\theta\\) with \\(\theta \in \left(-\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2}\right)\\), the same derivation gives:

\\[\int \frac{du}{\sqrt{u^2+1}} = \ln \\! \left(\sqrt{u^2+1}+u\right)+c \\]

It remains to return to the original variable. Substituting \\(u=x+2\\) back into the result, we obtain:

\\[\int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{x^2+4x+5}} = \ln \\! \left(\sqrt{x^2+4x+5}+x+2\right)+c \\]

> This completes the computation. The decisive step is the initial completing of the square, which exposes the canonical form hidden inside the general quadratic. Once the radical has been rewritten as \\(\sqrt{u^2+a^2}\\), the problem reduces to a case already solved, and the trigonometric substitution proceeds exactly as before.
