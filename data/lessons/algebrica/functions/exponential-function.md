## Introduction

1.The exponential function is a [function](<../functions/>) of the form:

$$f(x) = a^x, \quad a \in \mathbb{R}^+, \quad a \neq 1$$

2.For any base $a > 0,$ the graph of the exponential function $y = a^x$ always intersects the y-axis at the point $(0, 1),$ because $a^0 = 1.$ It lies entirely above the x-axis, since $a^x > 0$ for all $x \in \mathbb{R},$ and never intersects the x-axis, so $a^x \neq 0$ for any real $x.$ The behavior of the function depends on the value of the base $a,$ and three cases are distinguished.

## Laws of exponents

3.The rules that hold for [integer](<../integers/>) [powers](<../powers/>) extend to every real exponent, provided the base is positive. For all [real numbers](<../real-numbers/>) $x$ and $y$ and bases $a, b > 0$:

$$ \begin{align} a^{x+y} &= a^x a^y \\\\[6pt] (a^x)^y &= a^{xy} \\\\[6pt] (ab)^x &= a^x b^x \end{align} $$

4.The first identity is the functional equation of the exponential function, since it turns a sum in the exponent into a product of values. Together with $a^0 = 1,$ it fixes the value of a negative exponent. Setting $y = -x$ gives $a^x a^{-x} = a^0 = 1,$ so:

$$a^{-x} = \frac{1}{a^x}$$

5.A negative exponent inverts the corresponding positive power, which agrees with the fact that $a^x$ stays positive for every real $x.$

## Properties for $a$ greater than one

6.When $a > 1,$ the exponential function $y = a^x$ is [strictly increasing](<../increasing-and-decreasing-functions/>) over $\mathbb{R}.$

The graph of the exponential function  always lies above the x-axis. y x y = aˣ with a > 1 1

  * [Domain](<../determining-the-domain-of-a-function/>): $\mathbb{R}$
  * Range: $\mathbb{R}^+$

8.The limits as $x$ approaches the extremes of the domain are:

$$ \begin{align} \lim_{x \to -\infty} a^x &= 0^+ \\\\[6pt] \lim_{x \to +\infty} a^x &= +\infty \end{align} $$

## Properties for $a$ between zero and one

10.When $0 < a < 1,$ the exponential function $y = a^x$ is strictly decreasing over $\mathbb{R}.$

When the base a is between 0 and  1, the function is decreasing. y x y = aˣ 1

## Properties for $a$ equal to one

14.When $a = 1,$ the exponential function reduces to the constant function $y = 1^x = 1,$ which is excluded from the standard definition. Its graph is a horizontal line at height $y = 1.$

When a = 1, the function  is parallel to the x-axis. y x 1 a=1 y = aˣ

## Connection with the logarithmic function

16.The exponential function $y = a^x$ is the [inverse](<../inverse-function/>) of the [logarithmic function](<../logarithmic-function/>) $y = \log_a(x),$ provided $a > 0$ and $a \neq 1.$ This inverse relationship means:

$$a^{\log_a(x)} = x, \qquad \log_a(a^x) = x$$

17.When the base $a$ equals [Euler's number](<../euler-number-limit-sequence/>) $e \approx 2.71828,$ the function is the natural exponential function:

$$f(x) = e^x$$

## Exponential growth and decay

18.The natural exponential function is characterized by a differential equation together with an initial condition. It is the unique function whose rate of change equals its value at every point and whose value at the origin is one:

$$f'(x) = f(x), \qquad f(0) = 1$$

19.More generally, a quantity that changes at a rate proportional to its current size satisfies $f'(t) = k f(t),$ and the solutions of this equation are exactly the functions:

$$f(t) = C e^{kt}$$

20.Here $k$ is the proportional rate of change, and $C = f(0)$ is the value at the initial time $t = 0.$ The sign of $k$ sets the behavior. When $k > 0$ the quantity grows, multiplying by a fixed factor over each fixed time span; when $k < 0$ it decays toward zero. A population that doubles over equal intervals and a radioactive sample whose mass drops by a fixed proportion in equal times both obey this law.

21.For a decaying quantity the half-life is the time $t_{1/2}$ that reduces it to half its value. It follows from $C e^{k t_{1/2}} = \tfrac{1}{2} C$ by taking the [natural logarithm](<../logarithms/>) of both sides:

$$t_{1/2} = -\frac{\ln 2}{k}$$

22.The constant $C$ cancels, so the half-life does not depend on the initial amount. For a growing quantity the same computation gives the doubling time $\ln 2 / k.$

23.The same $e^{-\lambda t}$ decay describes the [exponential distribution](<../exponential-distribution/>), which models the waiting time between events that occur independently at a constant rate $\lambda > 0.$

## Generalized exponential functions

24.Three cases arise when the base or the exponent is replaced by a function of $x.$

25.

  * If the function has the form $y = [f(x)]^{g(x)},$ it is defined at those points where $f(x) > 0$ and $g(x)$ is defined.
  * If the function has the form $y = a^{f(x)}$ with $a > 0$ and $a \neq 1,$ it is defined wherever $f(x)$ is defined.
  * If the function has the form $y = [f(x)]^a,$ the domain condition depends on the sign of the exponent: the function is defined for $f(x) \geq 0$ when $a \in \mathbb{R}^+,$ and for $f(x) > 0$ when $a \in \mathbb{R}^-.$


## Limit, derivative and integral

26.The [remarkable limit](<../remarkable-limits/>) associated with the natural exponential function is:

$$\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{e^x - 1}{x} = 1$$

27.This limit shows that the derivative of $e^x$ at the origin equals one, consistently with $\frac{d}{dx} e^x = e^x.$ For a general base $a > 0,$ $a \neq 1,$ the corresponding limit is:

$$\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{a^x - 1}{x} = \ln(a)$$

28.The [derivative](<../derivatives/>) of the exponential function follows directly from the limit above. Differentiating $a^x$ with respect to $x$ gives:

$$\frac{d}{dx} a^x = a^x \ln(a)$$

$$\frac{d}{dx} e^x = e^x$$

29.Differentiating once more shows that the exponential function is [convex](<../convexity-and-concavity-of-functions/>) for every admissible base. The second derivative is:

$$\frac{d^2}{dx^2} a^x = a^x (\ln a)^2$$

30.Since $a^x > 0$ and $(\ln a)^2 > 0$ whenever $a \neq 1,$ the second derivative stays positive for every $x \in \mathbb{R},$ so the graph always bends upward, both when the function increases and when it decreases.

31.The [integral of the exponential function](<../integral-of-the-exponential-function/>) is obtained by reversing the differentiation formulas above:

$$\int a^x \ dx = \frac{a^x}{\ln(a)} + c$$

$$\int e^x \ dx = e^x + c$$

## Asymptotic growth

32.The exponential function grows faster than any [polynomial](<../polynomial-function/>) or [power function](<../power-function/>), and slower than the [factorial](<../factorial/>). For any $a > 1$ and any $k > 0$:

$$\lim_{x \to +\infty} \frac{x^k}{a^x} = 0 \qquad \lim_{x \to +\infty} \frac{a^x}{x!} = 0$$

33.This establishes the following hierarchy of growth rates as $x \to +\infty$:

$$\log x \ll x^k \ll a^x \ll x!$$

34.The table below illustrates this hierarchy for $a = 2.$

$x$| $\log_2 x$| $x^2$| $2^x$| $x!$  
---|---|---|---|---  
1| 0| 1| 2| 1  
2| 1| 4| 4| 2

> The hierarchy $\log x \ll x^k \ll a^x \ll x!$ appears in [asymptotic](<../asymptotes/>) analysis and in the classification of [algorithm complexity](<../big-o-notation/>) in computer science, where time and space requirements are measured against these growth rates.

## Hyperbolic functions derived from the exponential function

36.Combining $e^x$ and $e^{-x}$ yields the hyperbolic functions, which appear in analysis and geometry. The three main ones are the [hyperbolic sine](<../hyperbolic-sine-function/>), [hyperbolic cosine](<../hyperbolic-sine-and-cosine/>), and [hyperbolic tangent](<../hyperbolic-tangent-function/>), defined as follows:

$$\cosh(x) = \frac{e^{x} + e^{-x}}{2} \quad x \in \mathbb{R}$$

$$\sinh(x) = \frac{e^{x} - e^{-x}}{2} \quad x \in \mathbb{R}$$

$$\tanh(x) = \frac{\sinh(x)}{\cosh(x)} \quad x \in \mathbb{R} \quad \tanh(x) \in (-1, 1)$$

37.Because they are defined through the exponential function, hyperbolic functions are smooth and differentiable over $\mathbb{R}.$ The function $\tanh(x)$ is bounded, unlike $\sinh(x)$ and $\cosh(x),$ which grow without bound as $x \to \pm\infty.$

> 38.
> 
> Their definitions mirror those of the [trigonometric functions](<../sine-and-cosine/>), with the difference that $\cosh$ and $\sinh$ parametrize the unit [hyperbola](<../hyperbola/>) $x^2 - y^2 = 1$ rather than the [unit circle](<../unit-circle/>) $x^2 + y^2 = 1.$
